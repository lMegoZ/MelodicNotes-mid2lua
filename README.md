# MIDI to Lua file table module
Converts .mid files into .lua files for my The Binding of Isaac: Repentance mod. Showcase video of this tool soonâ„¢

Right now this only converts basic data like BPM and note starting points since it's specifically made for my mod.
But possibly in the future I will release a more general-use mid-to-lua script that will return EVERYTHING about the .mid file you want. This includes tempo, note start and end time in milliseconds, note name, instruments, and more.

This will probably need to be read by a lua library. You're free to look at the source code!

How to use:
Drag the .mid files into the executable. You can drag multiple ones.
